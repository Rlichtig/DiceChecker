Checklist of stuff we need to do


- Check variance between your die and what it should be
- display



- Main Menu Display
	- Two buttons 
		- Dice checker
		- Dice
		
- Dice Checker Menu
	- Music App esque
	- Add new profile button
	- Edit button
	- Back button



Dice checker part
- Select profile or start new one
	- title, number of dice, sides
- Buttons to enter in numbers 1-??
	- Seperate for each die
	- Format:
			(back button) Profile Name
			Goodness scale for die
				- Top and bottom parts
					- Top: Fairness
					- Bottom: Sureness
				- Color scale combining both top and bottom from red -> green
			Graph
				- Begin with info with combined die data, then splits to individual
				- After pressing commit, the graph updates.
				- Red line showing proper bell curve
				- Background color is the goodness scale color
			Buttons
				- 1 or 2, n <= 10 sided die
					- Special dice looking interface
					- Enter 1 die at a time
				- Other
					- Calculator/keypad looking interface
					- Enter total from dice
			Commit


Dice
- Same selection for profile - the name.
	????? - Visualization of top die is relative to number of sides on die
	- Number of die, and sides
	- Add ability to roll multiple die of different size (6 sided and 10 sided)
	- Rolling
		- Shake
		- Button on bottom
		
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dice Checker View (DCV)
- Frequency array (frequency of each type of roll) 
- Rolls int (total number of rolls)
- Graph view
- FC Scale 

Graph View (GV)
- Pointer to frequency array 
- Pointer to Rolls int

DCV
1. User inputs data into User Input View (UIV), hits enter 
2. UIV calculates total of dice 
3. DCV gets total from UIV
4. DCV increments Rolls 
5. DCV updates Frequency array based on new total 
6. DCV sends new total to the GV
	6a. GV checks if a new scale is required 
	6b. If new scale isn't required, update graph, go to step 7
	6c. If new scale is required, make new scale, update graph 
7. DCV sends new total to the FC Scale 
	7a. Update fairness
		- Requires:
			- pre-calculated theoretical probabilities 
			- frequencies 
		- Compares theoretical probabilities with experimental results 
	7b. Update certainty 
		- Requires:
			- Number of rolls 
			- Types of die 
	7c. Update background color
